<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Jack Loftus. I am currently studying Interaction Design. I chose this course because I'm passionate about how people interact with technology and how to create intuitive and engaging user experiences.</p>
    <p>My interests lie mainly in the media front such as film but also graphic design.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy learning about new technologies, reading, and experimenting with graphic design. I hope to one day work in a role where I can influence user experience and interface design on a larger scale.</p>
    <p>My ultimate career goal is to create art in the form of media that not only peaks interest but also inspires.</p>

<section id="skills">
    <h2>Skills & Interests</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the skills I have acquired or am currently working on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML & CSS - Learning the fundamentals of web design.</li>
        <li>Graphic Design - Experimenting with tools like Photoshop and Illustrator.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>In the future, I plan to expand my knowledge in JavaScript, user research, and prototyping to build more interactive and engaging designs.</p>
</section>

<section id="more-about">
    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <h3>Future Goals</h3>
    <p>In the future, I hope to work for a tech company where I can apply my skills in interaction design to help shape digital products that people love to use. I also want to keep learning the foundations of filmaking and somehow make a step into that world also.</p>

    <h3>People Who Inspire Me</h3>
    <p>I admire individuals like Steve Jobs. A man who was both innovative and charasmatic. He showed the world what true technological polish looked like.</p>
    
    <h3>My Favorite Projects</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite academic projects so far this year was reimagining music artists album covers and making something I thought was more suited.</p>

<section id="reflection">
    <h2>Reflection & Future Plans</h2>
    <p>This portfolio represents where I am now in my learning journey. It highlights my passion for interaction design and my commitment to improving my technical skills. If I were to expand the site, I would include a portfolio section to showcase my design work and projects. I hope to move abroad in future and carry my skillset across the globe.</p>
